This plugin makes it easy to find information on the medium.
This adds a new toolbar button.
If you are viewing a specific article in Medium, pressing the toolbar button will attempt to launch the page and send you to the next tab. 

This addon is created just for my own personal use.
You may use this if you find it useful. 

I have no plans to provide support for Chromium-based browsers because I cannot commit to maintaining two separate manifests.
Still, if somebody wants to develop this for hromium-based browsers, feel free to send me a pull request. 


### To do

Follow these steps if you'd like the new tab to open right after the current one.

1. Launch Firefox and type mo sa browser `about:config`
2. Search for `browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent`
3. Either double click on the row OR set the value to `true` and close
